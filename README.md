## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
turbo dev
# or one of these:
npm run dev
yarn dev
pnpm dev
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development dependencies

```sh
# cwebp e.g. https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/precompiled
# must be version 1.5.0 libsharpyuv: 0.4.1

# ImageMagick
brew install imagemagick
```

```sh
# fix `npm install` of npm module `canvas`
# https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues/1825#issuecomment-1090125736
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg
```

## Starship Symbols Source PNGs

Symbol PNGs should be unzipped in /media
- [SymbolsHighRes.zip](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/zip/Geomorphs/SymbolsHighRes.zip)
- [SmallCraftHighRes.zip](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/zip/Geomorphs/SmallCraftHighRes.zip)

Geomorph PNGs (background in hull symbols) should be unzipped in /media
- [Geomorphs.zip](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/zip/Geomorphs/Geomorphs.zip)

Related resources (less/more resolution)
- [Symbols.zip](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/zip/Geomorphs/Symbols.zip)
- [GeomorphsHighRes.zip](http://ericbsmith.no-ip.org/zip/Geomorphs/GeomorphsHighRes.zip)

Then you can run the various scripts (as needed) found inside `scripts/get-pngs.js`.


## Development only routes

These are removed in production via next.config output `export`.

```sh
curl --silent localhost:3000/api/connect/myFunUid/dev-events
curl --silent -XPOST localhost:3000/api/send-dev-event
curl --silent -XPOST localhost:3000/api/close-dev-events -d'{ "clientUid": 1234 }'
```

## Example NPC-CLI shell commands

  ```sh
  c=0
  while true; do
    spawn "rob_${c}" $( click 1 )
    w e.grantNpcAccess "rob_${c}" .
    c+=1
  done
  
  # commands work while paused via prefix `ptags=no-pause;`
  ptags=no-pause events

  # reset or save control state i.e. current view
  w view.controls.reset
  w view.controls.saveState

  # this command does not exit until the World is enabled
  test $( w disabled ) &&
    events '({ key }) => key === "enabled"' | take 1

  ```

## Bits and bobs

### `patch-package`

We can also patch `package1/node_modules/package2`
> https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package#nested-packages

This permits us to patch `three-stdlib` inside `@react-three/drei`.
```sh
npx patch-package @react-three/drei/three-stdlib
```


### Bump versions in our branch of recast-navigation-js

Currently tsconfig.json paths only works in webpack (`yarn dev-webpack`) not turbopack (`yarn dev`),
see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/72346.
This means that in dev we'll uncomment tsconfig paths and use webpack,
but after publishing we should re-comment these paths and use turbopack.

#### At `recast-navigation-js` repo root

1. Manually bump versions
  - search for current patch e.g. 0.39.1 and replace with next e.g. 0.39.2
  - do not include yarn.lock, files should be:
    > packages/recast-navigation{,-core,-generators,-playcanvas,-three,-wasm}

1. Run `yarn`

1. Commit and push e.g. to branch `feat/expose-off-mesh-anim`

1. Run `yarn publish`
    - ðŸ”” may have to wait a bit for registry to update

#### At `npc-cli-next` repo root

1. Bump package.json versions, e.g.

```json
  "@recast-navigation/core": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__core@0.39.2",
  "@recast-navigation/generators": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__generators@0.39.2",
  "@recast-navigation/three": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__three@0.39.2",
  "@recast-navigation/wasm": "npm:@rob-myers/recast-navigation__wasm@0.39.2",
```

1. Run `npm install`


### Debug on mobile hotspot

```sh
yarn dev

# get local ip address for mobile development
ipconfig getifaddr en0

# navigate to http://${ipAddress}:3000
```

### Fix VSCode push button error

> NPM module canvas was compiled against a different Node.js version

Following [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67935178/2917822) we can start VSCode in a terminal whose node version matches the repo's node version.

```sh
cd $REPO_ROOT
nvm use
code .
```

### Avoid nested transforms in SVGs

We don't support transforms applied to `<g>`s, for example in skin SVGs.
> ðŸ”” maybe we should...

In BoxySVG, you can avoid introducing transforms on `<g>`s by
- selecting all of its children (rather than the Group)
- e.g. Geometry > change Y.

In BoxySVG, if your `<g>` already has a transform you can use this trick:
> - drag contents outside Group
> - remove transform from Group (e.g. via elements panel E)
> - drag contents back into Group

### Convert to MP4 or GIF

```sh
# if necessary
brew install ffmpeg

# Convert mov to mp4
cd ~/Desktop
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/html-3d-example.mov -qscale 0 html-3d-example.mp4
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/html-3d-example.mov -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=10" -b:v 0 -crf 25 html-3d-example.mp4
ffmpeg -i ~/Desktop/html-3d-example.mov -filter_complex "[0:v] fps=60" -b:v 0 -crf 25 html-3d-example.mp4
```

### Deceleration in terms of time

Recast-Detour animates motion over offMeshConnections using times `0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ tmax`.

- `t=0` we're near the offMeshConnection.
- `t=tmid` we're at offMeshConnection start.
  > we introduce `tmid` in a branch
- `t=tmax` we're at offMeshConnection end.

Sometimes we want to exit the offMeshConnection at a different speed than we entered it,
 e.g. if we're just about to stop.

- Suppose move in 1D with:
  - init/final position `x(0) := 0`, `x(t_1) := x_1` where `t_1` unknown.
  - init/final velocity `v(0) := u_0`, `v(t_1) := u_1`.
- Suppose we constantly decelerate i.e. `dv/dt = a â‰¤ 0` from speed `u_0` to `u_1` at time `t_1`

It follows that:
- `v(t) = u_0 + a . t` for all `t â‰¥ 0`
- `x(t) = u_0 . t + a/2 . t^2` for all `t â‰¥ 0`.
- `v(t_1) = u_1` hence `t_1 = (u_0 - u_1) / |a|`
- `x(t_1) = x_1` hence `x_1 = ((u_0 - u_1) / |a|). ( u_0 - (u_0 - u_1) / 2 )`
  i.e. `x_1 = (1 / 2|a|) . (u_0 - u_1). (u_0 + u_1)`

Sanity check: if `u_0 = u_1` then `t_1 = x_1 = 0` i.e. immediate.
Sanity check: if `u_1 = 0` then `x_1 = 0.5 . 1/|a| . u_0^2`

Then we know:
- the deceleration `|a| = 0.5 . (1 / x_1) . (u_0 - u_1) . (u_0 + u_1)`.
- the time `t_1 = (u_0 - u_1) / |a| = 2 * x_1 * (1 / (u_0 + u_1))`

Finally, if we start decelerating at `t=tmid` we need to
change `tmax` to `tmid + t_1` using the above formula for `t_1`.
