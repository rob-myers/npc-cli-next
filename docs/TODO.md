# TODO

## Migrate from Gatsby

- 🚧 asset.js script -> World communication
  - ℹ️ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events
  - ℹ️ https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/48427#discussioncomment-5624604
  - ✅ can POST http://localhost:3000/send-dev-event in dev
    - next.config `output` cannot be `export` in dev
    - had to move `app/api` temporarily during build
  - ✅ can POST /send-dev-event in dev without moving files
    - use `export const dynamic = 'force-static';` in route.ts
  - ✅ POST http://localhost:3000/send-dev-event can send event to browser
    - ℹ️ https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/48427#discussioncomment-9791770
    - ✅ can connect SSE via /api/connect-dev-events and send initial message to browser
  - ✅ implement POST http://localhost:3000/send-dev-event
  - 🚧 can clean up connections
    - ✅ need some way to tell server we're finished
      - "static export" prevents /foo/[uid]/bar and query params,
      - however, maybe can send POST with JSON?
    - ✅ on reload page
    - 🚧 on hmr
      - maybe no need because we won't edit npc-cli/service/server-sent-events.js
  - ✅ browser reacts to server-sent event

- ❌ try fix `yarn build` breaking `yarn dev`
  - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/61228
- clean fetch-assets file
- try `bun` https://bun.sh/
- maybe move flexlayout-react/style/light.css "back" into layout.tsx

- 🚧 migrate assets.js script
  - ✅ store geomorphs.json in public
  - 🚧 npm scripts
    ```json
    ✅ "ts-script": "ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register -O '{ \"module\": \"commonjs\", \"isolatedModules\": false }'",
    ✅ "assets": "npm run ts-script scripts/assets -- --all",
    "assets-fast": "sucrase-node scripts/assets",
    ✅ "clean-assets": "rm static/assets/{assets.json,geomorphs.json} static/assets/2d/{obstacles,decor}.png{,.webp}",
    "cwebp": "npm run ts-script scripts/cwebp",
    ✅ "cwebp-fast": "sucrase-node scripts/cwebp",
    "get-pngs": "npm run ts-script scripts/get-pngs",
    "get-pngs-fast": "sucrase-node scripts/get-pngs",
    "watch-assets": "source scripts/watch-assets.sh",
    "watch-assets-nodemon": "sucrase-node scripts/assets-nodemon.js",
    "ws-server": "sucrase-node scripts/ws-server.js",
    "pre-push": "npm run assets-fast -- --prePush"
    ```
  - ✅ migrate enough media/* to get assets.js working
  - ✅ generate decor
  - ✅ cwebp-fast
