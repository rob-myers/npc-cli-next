# Basic Behaviour List

- Walk back and forth (two points).

```sh
# store two navigable points in an array
rm -f points
click | filter meta.nav | take 2 >> points

# spawn an npc at a navigable point, or a "do point"
spawn npcKey:rob at:$( click 1 )
w e.grantAccess . rob # all doors permitted

# ðŸš§ how to fix "potential ongoing computation" ?
while true; do
  # w n.rob.move $( points/0 ) '{ arriveAnim: "none" }' &&
  # w n.rob.move $( points/1 ) '{ arriveAnim: "none" }'
  points/0 | w n.rob.move - '{ arriveAnim: "none" }' &&
  points/1 | w n.rob.move - '{ arriveAnim: "none" }'
done
```

- Walk in a loop (n points).

- Go to bedroom, get into bed, say "good night", breath for a bit, start snoring.

- Many NPCs suddenly look at the same point.

- Music related e.g. move whilst music plays, stop when it stops.

- Wake up, get out of bed, drink tea, shit, shower and shave.

- Ill in bed (moaning), escorted to medical area, lies down, nurse comes to see them, starts diagnosis.
