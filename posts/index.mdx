## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun yet challenging problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
  A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.</SideNote>

This problem can be "solved" by restricting interactivity.
For example, racing games only permit physical collisions,
whereas puzzle games are often too abstract to express human behaviour.
In fact many games only offer *aggressive* NPCs, additionally constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it's too damn hard!

{/* Developers are wary of state-space explosions. */}
As behaviours become more complex, the Game's state-space explodes.
More things go wrong, meaning more debugging, meaning less time for other important tasks.
The number of states becomes so large it cannot be effectively explored and debugged.
How can composite behaviour be resolved if the developer has never encountered it?
Even if we've taken it into account, time-limited behaviour may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by the Player.
We shouldn't forget we're entertaining the Player,
rather than creating a World in which the Player is situated.
This leads us to intermediate objectives:
{/* We are creating a World _around_ the Player. */}
{/* It must be interwoven with the Player's experience, not an independent set of "plans". */}

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the Game World.</SideNote>
</Card>

They are a step towards the Underlying Problem.
If one human can appear as many,
we can try to learn how to simulate his/her behaviour.
Let's begin by seeing the system in action.
