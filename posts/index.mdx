This website is concerned with a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.

{/* Create a video game where every Non-Player Character <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>
behaves like a human-controlled character. The Player cannot distinguish the NPCs from human-controlled characters. */}
{/* where the Player cannot distinguish any Non-Player Character <SideNote>A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>
from human-controlled characters. */}
</Card>

This problem can be "solved" by constraining the environment e.g. abstract puzzles, card games, racing games.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption,
we know of no game solving the underlying problem.
No game even comes close.
We don't know how to tackle this problem directly.
