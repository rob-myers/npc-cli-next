## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun yet challenging problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

{/* <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.
</SideNote> */}

Actually we need to be more precise:
the underlying problem only makes sense when human behaviour can be expressed.
Racing games only permit physical collisions which ain't enough wiggle room.
Abstract puzzle games are also too constrained.
Even games with complex environments usually only offer *aggressive* NPCs,
restricted by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume our NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it's too damn hard!

Freely combining behaviours inevitably leads to state-space explosions.<SideNote>Even in very restricted settings e.g. [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).</SideNote>
The number of possible states becomes too large to effectively explore.
How can composite behaviour be resolved if the developer has never encountered it?
Even behaviour we have accounted for may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by the Player.
But there's a way to solve both problems i.e. only react to the Player.
We could fabricate everything around them, as and when we need to.

This leads us to intermediate objectives, stepping stones towards the underlying problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the game world.</SideNote>
</Card>

Reacting to the Player requires real-time control systems.
Solving the underlying problem would also require an "automated director" of these control systems.
As an intermediate step we permit a human Game Master to control these systems.
Then the underlying problem becomes (2) above: can a single human act indistinguishably from many?
