## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote> A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

This problem is often side-stepped by constraining interactions.
Abstract puzzle games restrict the possible moves.
Racing games restrict interaction to physical collisions.
Many games only involve aggressive NPCs, constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close).
{/* Such NPC behaviour has not improved dramatically for at least 20 years. */}

{/* ðŸš§ needs work */}
{/* We don't have to capture the minutiae of any particular video game, we just need enough */}
Why?
Well, maybe we're trying to run before we can walk.
For example, we don't really have a precise way of talking about NPC behaviour.
Our pursuit of the underlying problem has led us to the following objectives:

**Our Objectives**

{/* Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters. */}

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the Game World.</SideNote>
