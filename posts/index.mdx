## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
  A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.</SideNote>

    {
      img: WorldTwoNpcWebp,
      label: <>Our system <em>NPC CLI</em> is built into this site.</>,
      objectPosition: '0% 0%',
    },
    {
      img: FirstWithTtyWebp,
      label: <>CLI stands for <em>Command Line Interface.</em></>,
      objectPosition: '0% 70%',

This problem is often side-stepped.
Puzzle games restrict the possible moves.
Racing games restrict interaction to physical collisions.
Many games only involve aggressive NPCs, constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it's too damn hard!

{/* Developers are wary of state-space explosions. */}
As behavioural complexity increases, the Game's state space explodes.
More things go wrong, which means more debugging, which means less time for other important tasks.
The state space becomes so large that it cannot be effectively explored and debugged.
How can composite behaviour be resolved when the developer has never encountered it?
Also, behaviour with a time-limited existence may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by the Player.
We shouldn't forget we are entertaining the Player.
We are not creating a World in which the Player is situated.
We are creating a World _around_ the Player.
This leads us to intermediate objectives:
{/* It must be interwoven with the Player's experience, not an independent set of "plans". */}

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the Game World.</SideNote>
</Card>

They are a step towards the Underlying Problem.
If one human can appear as many,
we can try to learn how to simulate his/her behaviour.
Let's begin by seeing the system in action.
