## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun yet challenging problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

{/* <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.
</SideNote> */}

For the underlying problem to be meaningful,
"human behaviour" must be expressible.
Racing games only permit physical collisions, which ain't enough wiggle room.
Abstract puzzle games are also too constrained.
Even games with complex environments usually only offer *aggressive* NPCs,
restricted by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume our NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it's too damn hard!

In a nutshell:
freely combining behaviours yields state-space explosions.<SideNote>Even in very restricted settings e.g. [Conway's Game of Life](new-tab:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).</SideNote>
The number of states becomes too large to effectively explore.
How can composite behaviour be resolved if the developer has never encountered it?
Even behaviour we have accounted for may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by the Player.
But we can solve all these problems if we _continually react to the Player_.
Rather than situate them in a prefabrication,
we could fabricate everything around them, as and when we need to.

This leads to intermediate objectives, stepping stones towards the underlying problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the game world.</SideNote>
</Card>

Reacting continually to the Player requires real-time control systems.
Solving the underlying problem would also require an "automated director".
As an intermediate step we permit a human Game Master to control these systems.
Then the underlying problem becomes (2) above: can a single human act indistinguishably from many?
