## Intent

This blog is concerned with a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote> A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

    {
      img: WorldTwoNpcWebp,
      label: <>Our system <em>NPC CLI</em> is built into this site.</>,
      objectPosition: '0% 0%',
    },
    {
      img: ManyNpcTwoTtyWebp,
      label: <>CLI stands for <em>Command Line Interface.</em></>,
      objectPosition: '100% 0%',
    },
  ]}

This problem is traditionally "solved" by constraining the interactions.
Abstract puzzle games restrict the possible moves.
Racing games restrict interaction to physical collisions.
A vast number of games only involve aggressive NPCs, constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem.
Nothing even comes close.
Such NPC behaviour has not improved dramatically for 20 years.

Maybe we're trying to run before we can walk.
For example, we don't really have a precise way of talking about NPC behaviour.
Then in our pursuit of the underlying problem this blog has the following objectives:

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

{/* Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters. */}

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the Game World.</SideNote>
