## Intent

This blog is concerned with a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote> A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

    {

This problem is traditionally "solved" by constraining the environment.
Abstract puzzles games <SideNote>Card games or Tetris for example.</SideNote> restrict the possible moves.
Racing games restrict interaction to physical collisions.
A vast number of games only involve aggressive NPCs, constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs
can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption,
no known game solves the underlying problem.
Nothing even comes close.
It seems nobody knows how to tackle this problem directly.

But what about indirectly?
This brings us to our overall objectives:

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

{/* Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters. */}

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master <SideNote>G</SideNote> to act indistinguishably from many humans.
