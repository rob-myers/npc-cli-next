## Intent

This blog is concerned with a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

<Carousel
  slides={[
    { img: TestPng, label: 'foo' },
    { img: TestPng2, label: 'bar' },
  ]}
  aspectRatio={[1.4, 2]}
  maxHeight={500}
/>

This problem can be "solved" by constraining the environment e.g.
abstract puzzles, card games, racing games.
So let's assume the NPCs <SideNote>
A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> 
can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption,
no known game solves the underlying problem.
Nothing even comes close.
It seems nobody knows how to tackle this problem directly.

But what about indirectly?
This brings us to our overall objectives:

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

{/* Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters. */}

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master <SideNote>G</SideNote> to act indistinguishably from many humans.
</Card>
