## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun but difficult problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
  A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote> <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.</SideNote>

This problem is often side-stepped.
Abstract puzzle games restrict the possible moves.
Racing games restrict interaction to physical collisions.
Many games only involve aggressive NPCs, constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume the NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it is not feasible within the confines of a Game Development Cycle.

Developers are rightfully wary of state-space explosions.
As behavioural complexity increases, so too does the Game's number of states.
More things go wrong, which means more debugging, which means less time for other important tasks.
There are so many wrong turns.
Intelligent behaviour with a time-limited existence may go unnoticed, or be misinterpreted.
It must be interwoven with the Player's experience, not an independent set of "plans".

We won't tackle this problem within the confines of a Game Studio.
We won't try to run before we can walk.
Our pursuit of the underlying problem has led us to the following intermediate objectives:

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the Game World.</SideNote>
</Card>

This is a step towards the Underlying Problem.
If one human can appear as many,
we can try to learn how to simulate his/her behaviour.
Let's begin by seeing the system in action.
