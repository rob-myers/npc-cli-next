## Intent

This blog is driven by a fun yet challenging problem.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Underlying Problem**

Create a video game whose Non-Player Characters behave just like human-controlled characters.
</Card>

The underlying problem is related to Turing's _Imitation Game_:
the Player is the interrogator,
the questions are video game interactions.
Can the NPCs fool the Player? <SideNote>
A "Non-Player Character" (NPC) is a video game character not controlled by the Player.</SideNote>

{/* <SideNote>
  Imagine a human hired to "play the part" of an NPC,
  rather than another human Player.
</SideNote> */}

We need to be more precise
because restricting interactivity causes the underlying problem to disappear.
For example, racing games only permit physical collisions, which isn't enough to express interesting behaviour.
Likewise abstract puzzle games are too inflexible.
Many other games only offer *aggressive* NPCs, additionally constrained by their time-limited existence.
So let's assume our NPCs can move freely through a 3D environment without time constraints.
Under this assumption, no known game solves the underlying problem
(or even comes close). But why?

> Because it's too damn hard!

Freely combining behaviours leads to state-space explosions.<SideNote>Even in very restricted settings e.g. [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).</SideNote>
The number of states becomes too large to effectively explore.
How can composite behaviour be resolved if the developer has never encountered it?
Even behaviour we have accounted for may go unnoticed or be misinterpreted by the Player.
But there's a way to solve both problems i.e. always react to the Player.
We could fabricate everything around them, as and when we need to.

This leads us to intermediate objectives.

<Card id="underlying-problem"> 
**Our Objectives**

1. Build real-time control systems for NPCs.
2. Enable a Game Master to act indistinguishably from many humans. <SideNote>
  A Game Master (aka Dungeon Master) is another human who controls the game world.</SideNote>
</Card>

They are a step towards the Underlying Problem.
If one human can appear as many,
we can try to learn how to simulate his/her behaviour.
Let's begin by seeing the system in action.
